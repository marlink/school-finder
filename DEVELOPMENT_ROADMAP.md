## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

### **Development Environment Setup**
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev                    # http://localhost:3000

# Database management
npx prisma studio             # http://localhost:5555
npx prisma migrate dev        # Apply migrations
npx prisma generate           # Update client (CRITICAL for builds)

# Build and test
npm run build                 # Production build (includes prisma generate)
npm run test                  # Run tests
npm run lint                  # Code quality check
```

### **🚨 CRITICAL: Prisma Deployment Requirements**
**Learned from production deployment issues:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "prisma generate && next build"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "prisma": "^6.12.0"
  }
}
```
- **Build Script**: MUST include `prisma generate` before `next build`
- **Vercel Deployment**: Requires Prisma CLI in devDependencies
- **Error Prevention**: Without this, builds fail with "@prisma/client did not initialize yet"

### **Environment Variables Checklist**
```bash
# ✅ Currently Configured
DATABASE_URL=mysql://...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# ⚠️ Need Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=    # For maps integration
APIFY_API_TOKEN=                    # For data scraping
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=                  # For payments (future)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=             # For payments (future)
```

## 📋 **Development Standards**

### **🎯 Focused Session Rules (NEW)**
- **Session Duration**: 30-45 minutes maximum per focused task
- **Context Management**: Start each session with clear objectives
- **LLM Switching**: Use appropriate LLM for task type (Claude/Gemini/DeepSeek)
- **Progress Tracking**: Document completion status after each session
- **Handoff Protocol**: Clear summary for next session continuation

### **Code Quality Requirements**
- ALL imports MUST use exact case matching
- Components MUST have proper TypeScript types
- Use `<Suspense>` for client-side hooks like `useSearchParams()`
- Follow PascalCase for components, kebab-case for utilities

### **Build Process Validation**
- MUST run `npm run build` before deployment
- MUST verify all pages render without SSR errors
- Remove test files from production builds
- Clean up unused locale files

### **Internationalization Standards**
- Only `pl.json` and `eng.json` are supported

## 📚 **Documentation Structure**

- **README.md**: Project overview and getting started
- **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md**: Technical standards and best practices
- **This file**: Comprehensive roadmap and status

## 🧹 **Project Structure Analysis & Cleanup**

### **✅ DUPLICATE ANALYSIS COMPLETE - STRUCTURE IS OPTIMAL**

After comprehensive analysis of the project structure, **your current setup is correct and follows best practices**. Here's the detailed breakdown:

#### **📦 Package.json Structure - CORRECT AS-IS**
```
Root package.json (6 lines):
├── @radix-ui/react-switch: ^1.2.5
└── apify-client: ^2.12.6

Production package.json (81 lines):
├── Full Next.js 15 application dependencies
├── All @radix-ui components (12 packages)
├── Supabase, Prisma, Testing libraries
└── Complete development toolchain
```

**✅ Verdict**: **KEEP BOTH** - This is a proper workspace/monorepo structure where:
- Root manages shared utilities (Apify client for data scraping)
- Production contains the complete Next.js application
- Each has its own dependency tree and node_modules

#### **🔧 Configuration Files - NO DUPLICATES FOUND**
All configuration files are properly isolated in `/school-finder-production/`:
```
Configuration Files (8 total):
├── eslint.config.mjs
├── jest.config.js  
├── next.config.js
├── playwright.config.ts
├── postcss.config.mjs
├── tsconfig.json
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

**✅ Verdict**: **PERFECT ISOLATION** - No duplicates, all configs in correct location

#### **📚 Documentation Structure - WELL ORGANIZED**
```
Root Level (Project Overview):
├── DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md (this file)
└── QUICK_START_GUIDE.md

Production Level (Technical Details):
├── README.md
├── PROJECT_GUIDE.md
├── DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md
└── LIVE_STATUS.md

Planning Archives:
├── plan-do-not-remove/ (29 files)
└── do-not-remove/-Trash/ (12 files)
```

**✅ Verdict**: **LOGICAL SEPARATION** - Each level serves its purpose

### **🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS**

#### **🟢 NO ACTION REQUIRED (Structure is Optimal)**
- ✅ Package.json setup follows monorepo best practices
- ✅ No configuration file duplicates found
- ✅ Documentation is logically distributed
- ✅ All critical files are in correct locations

#### **🟡 OPTIONAL CLEANUP (Low Priority)**
- Archive `do-not-remove/-Trash/` to reduce visual clutter
- Consider consolidating similar docs in `plan-do-not-remove/`

#### **🔴 CRITICAL: DO NOT REMOVE**
- ❌ **Never remove** root `package.json` - needed for workspace tools
- ❌ **Never remove** any `package-lock.json` files - dependency integrity
- ❌ **Never remove** production directory structure - live application

### **💡 WHY THIS STRUCTURE WORKS**

1. **Workspace Pattern**: Root manages shared tools (Apify), production manages app
2. **Dependency Isolation**: Each package.json manages its own scope
3. **Clean Separation**: No configuration conflicts between levels
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add more packages/tools at root level
5. **Development Flow**: `npm run dev` works from production directory

### **🚨 MULTIPLE LOCKFILES WARNING EXPLAINED**
The warning about multiple lockfiles is **EXPECTED and CORRECT**:
- Root lockfile: Manages Apify client and shared tools
- Production lockfile: Manages Next.js application dependencies
- This is standard for workspace/monorepo structures

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Build Failures**: Check TypeScript errors with `npx tsc --noEmit`
2. **SSR Errors**: Wrap client hooks in `<Suspense>` boundaries
3. **Locale Issues**: Verify files exist in `/messages/` directory
4. **Database Issues**: Run `npx prisma generate` after schema changes
5. **Multiple Lockfiles Warning**: This is expected - root and production have separate dependency trees

### **Quick Debugging**
```bash
# Check application status
npm run dev && open http://localhost:3000

# Verify database connection
npx prisma studio

# Check build status
npm run build

# Workspace structure validation
ls -la package*.json  # Should show both root and production files
```
