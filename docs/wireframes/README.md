## Next Steps

1. Review wireframes with stakeholders for feedback
2. Finalize the design system (colors, typography, component library)
3. Create interactive prototypes to test user flows across all views
4. Conduct usability testing with representative users
5. Implement responsive designs in code
6. Develop component library based on the wireframe patterns
7. Integrate with backend systems for dynamic data display
