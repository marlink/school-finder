# 🔄 Session Handover Documentation

## 📅 Current Session Handover - January 2025

### 🎯 Session Summary
**Focus**: Search Suggestions Z-Index Fix & UI Improvements
**Duration**: Single session
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

### ✅ Major Achievements

#### 🎯 Search Suggestions Z-Index Fix - COMPLETED
**Problem**: Search suggestion dropdown was being covered by the stats section below it

**Root Cause**: 
- Search suggestions using `z-50` were insufficient to appear above stats section
- Search form container lacked proper z-index stacking context
- Multiple search components had inconsistent z-index values

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Updated All Search Suggestion Components**:
   - `src/components/search/SearchSuggestions.tsx`: Changed from `z-50` to `z-[9999]`
   - `src/components/enhanced-search/enhancedsearchbar.tsx`: Changed from `z-50` to `z-[9999]`
   - `src/components/search/MCPSearchBar.tsx`: Changed from `z-50` to `z-[9999]`
   - `src/components/search/LocationSearch.tsx`: Changed from `z-50` to `z-[9999]`

2. **Enhanced Search Form Container**:
   - `src/app/(main)/page.tsx`: Added `relative z-[10000]` to search form container
   - Created proper stacking context hierarchy

**Result**: 
- ✅ Search suggestions now appear above all page content
- ✅ No more dropdown obscuring by stats section
- ✅ Consistent z-index hierarchy across all search components
- ✅ Improved user experience for search functionality

#### 🎨 Previous Fixes (Confirmed Working)
- ✅ **Google Maps API**: Multiple loading error resolved
- ✅ **Navbar Spacing**: Fixed `MainLayout.tsx` with `pt-16` padding
- ✅ **Database Population**: 20 realistic Polish schools added with proper JSON formatting
