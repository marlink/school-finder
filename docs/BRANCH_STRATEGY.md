# 🌿 Simplified Branch Strategy Guide

## 🎯 **Recommended: 2-Branch Strategy**

### **Why 2 Branches Instead of 3?**

✅ **Simpler workflow** - Less complexity for the team  
✅ **Faster deployments** - Direct staging → production flow  
✅ **Easier maintenance** - Fewer branches to manage  
✅ **Better for small teams** - Marlink team efficiency  

## 🚀 **Optimized Workflow**

### **Branch Structure:**
```
main (production)
├── staging (pre-production)
└── feature/* (development)
```

### **Development Flow:**
```
1. feature/new-search → staging (auto-deploy to staging)
2. staging → main (auto-deploy to production)
```

## 📊 **Comparison: 2 vs 3 Branches**

| Aspect | 2-Branch | 3-Branch |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Complexity** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Speed** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Team Efficiency** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Error Prone** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| **Maintenance** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |

## 🔄 **Updated Deployment Flow**

### **Feature Development:**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/school-search-improvements

# 2. Develop and test locally
npm run dev

# 3. Push and create PR to staging
git push origin feature/school-search-improvements
# Create PR: feature/school-search-improvements → staging
```

### **Staging Deployment:**
```bash
# 4. Merge to staging (auto-deploys to staging environment)
git checkout staging
git merge feature/school-search-improvements
git push origin staging
# ✅ Auto-deploys to staging.school-finder.com
```

### **Production Deployment:**
```bash
# 5. After testing on staging, merge to main
git checkout main
git merge staging
git push origin main
# ✅ Auto-deploys to school-finder.com
```

## 🛡️ **Quality Gates**
