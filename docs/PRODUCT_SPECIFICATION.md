## 1. Project Overview

The School Finder Portal is a web application designed to simplify the process of discovering and evaluating schools in Poland. Users can easily search for schools, access essential information including basic school details, Google ratings visualized as stars, and location map thumbnails. The platform also leverages a custom sentiment analysis of extracted comments to provide an additional layer of insight into school quality. A secure, simple registration/login system allows users to personalize their experience by saving favorite schools. The entire platform will operate with a strong commitment to RODO (GDPR) compliant data handling.

## 2. Goals

- **Empower Users**: Provide a user-friendly platform for quickly identifying schools that meet their specific criteria.
- **Inform Decision-Making**: Offer a comprehensive view of each school, combining objective data (location, official details) with subjective insights (Google reviews, sentiment analysis, user ratings).
- **Improve Accessibility**: Make school information readily available to all users, regardless of technical expertise.
- **Personalize Experience**: Allow users to bookmark and revisit schools they are interested in.
- **Ensure Trust**: Handle user data responsibly and transparently, adhering to RODO/GDPR regulations.
- **Provide Administrative Control**: Enable specific users to manage platform data and settings securely.
- **Support Parents**: Help parents find schools close to their accommodation, or easy to commute to for children.
- **Support Students**: Allow children and teenagers to see school subjects, specialization, photos, social media presence, and website links.

## 3. Target Audience

- Parents and guardians seeking the right school for their children.
- Students looking for higher education institutions.
- Individuals relocating to Poland and needing to find suitable schools.
- Anyone researching educational institutions in Poland.
- Platform Administrators: Designated users responsible for maintaining the portal's data integrity and functionality.

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1. School Discovery & Search

- **Search by Region**: Users can select a specific region in Poland (e.g., Wielkopolska, Małopolska) to filter schools within that area.
- **Search by City**: Users can type in a specific city name to find schools located in that city.
- **Search by School Type**: Users can filter schools based on type:
  - Kindergarten (Przedszkole)
  - Primary School (Szkoła Podstawowa)
  - Middle School / Junior High School (Gimnazjum - Note: Consider current educational structure)
  - High School / Lyceum (Liceum)
  - Technical School (Technikum)
  - Vocational School (Szkoła Zawodowa)
  - Special Education School (Szkoła Specjalna)
  - Higher Education (Uniwersytet, Politechnika, etc.)
- **Keyword Search (Optional)**: Allow users to enter keywords (e.g., "bilingual," "music program") to further refine search results.

### 4.2. School Information Display

For each school, display the following information clearly and concisely:

- **Basic School Details**:
  - School Name
  - Address
  - Contact Information (Phone, Email, Website - if available)
  - School Type
  - Official School ID (if available)
- **Google Ratings**:
  - Fetch average Google rating via API.
  - Visualize the Google rating using a star system (e.g., 4.5 out of 5 stars).
- **Location Map Thumbnail**:
  - Embed a small, static or interactive map thumbnail showing the school's precise location.
  - Clicking the thumbnail could potentially link to a larger, interactive map view.

### 4.3. Sentiment Analysis & Custom Rating

- **Comment Extraction**: A backend process will extract comments from various online sources (e.g., Google Reviews, relevant educational forums).
- **Sentiment Analysis**: A custom script will analyze these extracted comments:
  - Identify positive ("pluses") and negative ("minuses") keywords/phrases.
  - Assign weights to these sentiment indicators.
  - Calculate an overall sentiment score based on these weighted values.
- **Custom Sentiment Rating**: Display this calculated score as a user-friendly rating (e.g., star visualization) to offer a unique perspective on the school's perceived quality.

### 4.4. User Accounts & Personalization

- **Simple Registration/Login System**:
  - Provide a straightforward process for users to create an account (e.g., using email/password, or social logins like Google/GitHub via NextAuth.js).
  - Securely handle user credentials.
- **Ability to Save Favorite Schools**:
  - Logged-in users will have an option (e.g., a "heart" or "star" icon) on each school's profile to mark it as a favorite.
  - A dedicated "My Favorites" or "Saved Schools" section will be available within the user's account dashboard, listing all their favorited schools.
- **User Ratings (Post-Sign-Up)**:
  - Allow logged-in users to submit their own star ratings for schools.
  - Implement rate limiting: Each user can only rate a school once.
  - The overall displayed rating for a school will be an aggregate of the Google rating, the custom sentiment analysis, and user-submitted ratings.
  - Rating Tooltip: When an unregistered/logged-out user attempts to interact with the rating system, display a tooltip: "Please sign up or log in to rate this school."

### 4.5. Admin Access Control

- **Role-Based Access**: Implement a system where certain users are designated as administrators.
- **Administrative Dashboard**: Provide a secure area for administrators to:
  - Manage school data (add, edit, delete schools).
  - Oversee user accounts.
  - Monitor platform activity.
  - Manage scraping configurations or review scraped data.
  - Potentially moderate user-submitted content (if applicable).
- **Secure Credential Management**:
  - Administrator Email: For administrative access, the email neatgroupnet@gmail.com will be designated.
  - Administrator Password: The password associated with this administrator account MUST NOT be stored directly in this document or in the codebase. Instead, it shall be securely managed via:
    - Environment Variables: Stored as a secure environment variable (e.g., ADMIN_PASSWORD) within the deployment platform (Vercel) and in a local .env.local file during development.
    - Secure Hashing: If the password is to be set or reset, it must be securely hashed (e.g., using bcrypt) before storage.

### 4.6. User Search Limits & Subscription Model

To balance server load and encourage user registration, we'll implement a limited free search policy with a subscription option for unlimited access.

- **Free Search Limitation**:
  - Each user (identified by IP address or cookie, unless logged in) is allowed 3 free searches per session or within a short time window (e.g., 24 hours).
  - After the 3rd search, they are prompted to log in or sign up for unlimited access.
  - If they choose not to register, they can perform one more search (the 4th) before being blocked by a persistent overlay/modal.

- **User Flow**:
  - First & Second Search: User searches for schools (e.g., "kindergartens in Warsaw"). Results display normally.
  - Third Search: User searches again. After results, a non-intrusive banner appears: "You have 1 more free search. Sign up to explore unlimited schools!" (with a dismiss option).
  - Fourth Search: User searches again. A modal overlay appears: "You've reached your free search limit! Sign up for 3 more searches or upgrade to our Premium Plan." (with "Sign Up," "Log In," and "Upgrade" buttons).
  - Post-Action:
    - If they sign up/log in, their search count resets, and they get unlimited access.
    - If they upgrade, they get unlimited access.
    - If they dismiss/ignore, they are blocked from further searches until the time window resets or they register.

- **Subscription Model**:
  - Plans:
    | Plan | Price (PLN) | Price (GBP) | Features |
    |:-----|:------------|:------------|:---------|
    | Free | 0 | 0 | 3 searches/session, basic data access |
    | Premium | 4.99 | 2.99 | Unlimited searches, advanced filters, saved searches, priority sentiment updates |

## 5. Data Privacy & Compliance (RODO/GDPR)

- **User Consent**: Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing during the registration process. A clear link to the Privacy Policy will be provided.
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only the data necessary for the core functionality of the portal (e.g., for authentication, saving favorites, submitting ratings).
- **Secure Storage**: Implement secure methods for storing user data, especially sensitive information like passwords (hashed and salted). Utilize Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling for optimal performance and scalability.
- **Privacy Policy**: Maintain a clear, accessible, and comprehensive Privacy Policy outlining:
  - What data is collected.

## 8. Data Update Mechanism

- **Static Data Storage**:
  - Scraped data is stored in a static directory (e.g., static/school-data-backups/) or a dedicated database table marked as is_staging = true.
  - Live site content references the production dataset (e.g., school_data_production).

- **Scheduled Nightly Replacement**:
  - Use Vercel Cron Jobs (serverless) or AWS Lambda@Edge to trigger a script at 1 AM local time.
  - Alternative: Neon database scheduled functions or external cron services.
  - Process Flow:
    - Scraping: Admin triggers a manual scrape (via Apify/Vercel function) and saves data to staging/.
    - Validation: System checks for errors (e.g., missing fields, duplicate entries).
    - Swap at Midnight: Production references switch from production/ to staging/.
    - Old data in production/ is archived (e.g., archived-2024-07-10.json).
    - Cleanup: Remove stale staging data after 24 hours.

- **User Experience Considerations**:
  - No Disruption: Users interacting with the site during the update will always see the stable production data.
  - New Sessions After Update: Users visiting the site after midnight will see fresh data.
  - Fallback Mechanism: If the scheduled job fails, retain production data and alert admins via email.

## 9. Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Filtering**: Implement more granular search filters (e.g., school size, extracurricular activities, language of instruction).
- **School Comparison**: Allow users to compare multiple schools side-by-side.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provide school recommendations based on user preferences and past searches.
- **Integration with Educational Resources**: Link to relevant government education websites or other reputable sources.
- **User Commenting**: Allow logged-in users to post their own text comments/reviews.
