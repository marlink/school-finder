## Incident #001 - Exposed Credentials in Environment Files
**Date:** January 4, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** RESOLVED  

### Issue Description
Multiple environment files contained exposed API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information that were committed to version control.

### Exposed Credentials Found
- Database connection strings (PostgreSQL with credentials)
- Stack Auth API keys (project ID, publishable keys, secret keys)
- Google Maps API key
- Apify API tokens
- Supabase keys (service role and anon keys)
- Vercel OIDC tokens
- Firecrawl API key
- Hyperbrowser API key
- MCP API key (JWT token)

### Files Affected
- `.env.local` - âœ… FIXED (credentials replaced with placeholders)
- `.env.production` - âœ… FIXED (credentials replaced with placeholders)
- `.env.staging` - âœ… FIXED (credentials replaced with placeholders)
- `.env.vercel` - âœ… REMOVED (file deleted)
- `.env.vercel.production` - âœ… REMOVED (file deleted)
- `.env.testing` - âœ… SAFE (already contained placeholders)
- `.env.example` - âœ… SAFE (template file with placeholders)

### Actions Taken
1. âœ… Replaced all exposed credentials with placeholder values
2. âœ… Deleted Vercel environment files containing production credentials
3. âœ… Verified .gitignore properly excludes environment files
4. âœ… Committed changes to remove exposed credentials from Git history

### Required Follow-up Actions
1. ðŸ”„ **ROTATE ALL EXPOSED API KEYS IMMEDIATELY**
   - Google Maps API key
   - Stack Auth credentials
   - Apify API tokens
   - Database credentials
   - Supabase keys
   - All other exposed API keys

2. ðŸ”„ **Update Vercel environment variables**
   - Set new credentials in Vercel dashboard
   - Remove old credentials from Vercel

3. ðŸ”„ **Monitor for unauthorized usage**
   - Check API usage logs for suspicious activity
   - Monitor database access logs

### Prevention Measures
- âœ… .gitignore properly configured to exclude .env files
- âœ… Only .env.example template committed to repository
- âœ… Security documentation created
- ðŸ”„ TODO: Implement pre-commit hooks to scan for credentials
- ðŸ”„ TODO: Add automated security scanning to CI/CD pipeline

### Notes
- All environment files now contain only placeholder values
- Actual credentials should be set locally and in deployment environments only
- Never commit real credentials to version control
