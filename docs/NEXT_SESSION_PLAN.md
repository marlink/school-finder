# 🎯 Next Session Action Plan

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE DECISIONS NEEDED**

### 1. **Database Strategy** 
**Question**: Do you want to:
- **Option A**: Keep current Neon database and build from scratch ✅ **(RECOMMENDED)**
- **Option B**: Import the 14-table database to Neon
- **Option C**: Hybrid approach

**My Recommendation**: Option A - Your current Neon setup is working, Stack Auth is configured. Let's build clean.

### 2. **Supabase Cleanup Priority**
**Question**: Should we:
- **Immediate**: Remove all Supabase code now (30 min cleanup)
- **Gradual**: Remove as we encounter issues
- **Keep**: Maintain hybrid for some reason

**My Recommendation**: Immediate cleanup - you don't need Supabase anymore.

### 3. **Stack Auth First User**
**Action Needed**: 
- Register the first user to activate Stack Auth fully
- This will unlock all authentication features

## 🔧 **WHAT I CAN DO RIGHT NOW**
