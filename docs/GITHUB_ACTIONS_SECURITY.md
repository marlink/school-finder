# GitHub Actions Security Automation

## 🛡️ Overview

The School Finder Portal implements comprehensive automated security testing through GitHub Actions workflows to maintain production-ready security standards.

## 📅 Automated Security Schedule

### Weekly Security Testing
- **Workflow**: `security-weekly.yml`
- **Schedule**: Every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC
- **Trigger**: `cron: '0 9 * * 1'`
- **Manual Trigger**: Available via workflow dispatch

### Continuous Security (CI/CD)
- **Workflow**: `ci-cd.yml` (enhanced security job)
- **Trigger**: Every push/PR to main/staging branches
- **Integration**: Blocks deployment if security tests fail

## 🔧 Security Components Tested

### 1. Security Test Suite (`npm run security:test`)
- **SQL Injection Protection**: 100% success rate required
- **XSS Prevention**: Comprehensive payload testing
- **CSRF Protection**: Token validation
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema testing
- **Rate Limiting**: API protection verification

### 2. Dependency Security
- **NPM Audit**: Moderate and high-severity vulnerability scanning
- **Snyk Integration**: Advanced vulnerability detection
- **Outdated Packages**: Monthly identification and flagging

### 3. Code Integrity
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Ensures type safety
- **ESLint Security Rules**: Code quality and security patterns
- **Security Implementation**: Validates presence of security files

## 📊 Security Workflows

### Weekly Security Testing Workflow

```yaml
name: Weekly Security Testing
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Every Monday 9 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:
```

**Features:**
- Comprehensive security test execution
- Automated security report generation
- GitHub issue creation on failures
- Monthly extended audits
- Security artifact retention (90 days)

### Enhanced CI/CD Security Job

```yaml
security:
  name: Comprehensive Security Audit
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

**Features:**
- Integrated with deployment pipeline
- Blocks staging/production deployment on failures
- Real-time security validation
- Security score reporting

## 🚨 Incident Response Automation

### Automatic Issue Creation
When security tests fail, the system automatically:

1. **Creates GitHub Issue** with:
   - Detailed failure information
   - Direct links to workflow logs
   - Priority level assignment
   - 24-hour resolution deadline

2. **Issue Template**:
   ```markdown
   ## 🚨 Weekly Security Test Failure Alert
   
   **Priority Level**: 🔴 CRITICAL
   **Due Date**: Within 24 hours
   **Assigned to**: @developer
   
   ### Failed Components
   - [List of failed security tests]
   
   ### Immediate Actions Required
   1. Review workflow logs
   2. Download security report
   3. Investigate root cause
   4. Fix immediately
   ```

### Notification System
- **Success**: Green checkmark with security score
- **Failure**: Red alert with immediate action items
- **Artifacts**: Security reports uploaded for analysis

## 📈 Security Monitoring Dashboard

### Current Status
- **Security Score**: 10/10 ⭐
- **Test Success Rate**: 100% (33/33 tests)
- **Last Audit**: Automated via GitHub Actions
- **Vulnerability Count**: 0 high-severity

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Security test pass/fail rates
- Dependency vulnerability trends
- Code quality metrics
- Deployment security gates

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### Deployment Dependencies
```yaml
deploy-staging:
  needs: [test, security]  # Security must pass

deploy-production:
  needs: [test, security, e2e-tests]  # Security blocks production
```

### Security Gates
- **Staging**: Requires security audit pass
- **Production**: Requires comprehensive security validation
- **PR Merges**: Security tests must pass before merge

## 📋 Manual Security Commands

### Local Testing
```bash
# Run security test suite
npm run security:test

# Run full security check
npm run security:check

# Run complete security audit
npm run security:full
```

### Workflow Dispatch Options
- **Full Security Test**: Complete security validation
- **Security Only**: Just the security test suite
- **Dependency Audit**: Focus on package vulnerabilities
- **Vulnerability Scan**: Advanced threat detection

## 🔧 Configuration

### Required Secrets
```yaml
SNYK_TOKEN: # For advanced vulnerability scanning
CODECOV_TOKEN: # For coverage reporting
VERCEL_TOKEN: # For deployment
VERCEL_ORG_ID: # Organization ID
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: # Project ID
```

### Environment Variables
```yaml
NODE_VERSION: '18'
NODE_ENV: production/test
```

## 📊 Reporting and Artifacts

### Weekly Security Reports
- **Location**: GitHub Actions artifacts
- **Retention**: 90 days
- **Format**: Markdown with detailed metrics
- **Content**:
  - Test results summary
  - Security score tracking
  - Action items and recommendations
  - Compliance status

### Monthly Extended Audits
- **Frequency**: First Monday of each month
- **Scope**: Extended dependency analysis
- **Reports**: Annual retention
- **Content**:
  - Comprehensive security assessment

  - Compliance verification

## 🚀 Best Practices

### Security Workflow Maintenance
1. **Weekly Review**: Monitor automated test results
2. **Monthly Updates**: Review and update security patterns
3. **Quarterly Assessment**: Full security architecture review
4. **Annual Audit**: Complete penetration testing

### Failure Response Protocol
1. **Immediate**: Stop all deployments
2. **Within 1 Hour**: Investigate root cause
3. **Within 24 Hours**: Implement fix and verify
4. **Post-Resolution**: Update security patterns if needed
