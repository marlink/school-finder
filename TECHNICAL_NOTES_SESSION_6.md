# Session 6: Test Suite Resolution - Technical Notes

## Overview
This session focused on resolving critical testing infrastructure issues that were preventing the test suite from running successfully. The main challenges were database connection conflicts, environment configuration issues, and Jest setup problems.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Database Connection & Mocking Issues
**Problem:** Tests were attempting to connect to the actual database, causing prepared statement conflicts and connection errors.

**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive mocking strategy:
- Mocked `@/lib/db` to return mock Prisma client
- Mocked `prisma.user.findUnique()` and `prisma.userSearches.create()`
- Mocked `next-auth/next` `getServerSession()` to return null (unauthenticated user)

### 2. API Response Structure Mismatch
**Problem:** Tests expected `data.pagination.total` but API returned `data.pagination.totalCount`.

**Solution:** Updated test expectations to match actual API response structure and enhanced mock data with all required fields.

### 3. Jest Configuration Issues
**Problem:** JSX/TSX compilation errors and environment conflicts between API and component tests.

**Solution:** Implemented multi-project Jest configuration:
- **API Tests Project:** Node.js environment for `src/app/api/**/*.test.ts`
- **Component Tests Project:** jsdom environment for `src/components/**/*.test.tsx`
- Proper transform configuration for TypeScript and JSX

### 4. Playwright Integration Conflict
**Problem:** Playwright e2e tests were being incorrectly invoked by Jest.

**Solution:** Added `testPathIgnorePatterns` to exclude `tests/e2e/` directory from Jest runs.

## Key Files Modified

### 1. `src/app/api/search/schools/__tests__/route.test.ts`
- Added comprehensive mocking for database operations
- Corrected API response structure expectations
- Enhanced mock school data with all required fields
- Added proper authentication mocking

### 2. `jest.config.ts`
- Implemented multi-project configuration
- Separated API and component test environments
- Updated ts-jest configuration to modern syntax
- Added proper file extensions and transform settings

## Technical Implementation Details

### Mock Strategy
```typescript
// Database mocking
jest.mock('@/lib/db', () => ({
  prisma: {
    user: { findUnique: jest.fn() },
    userSearches: { create: jest.fn() }
  }
}));

// Authentication mocking
jest.mock('next-auth/next', () => ({
  getServerSession: jest.fn()
}));
```

### Jest Multi-Project Configuration
```typescript
export default {
  projects: [
    {
      displayName: 'API Tests',
      testEnvironment: 'node',
      testMatch: ['<rootDir>/src/app/api/**/*.test.ts']
    },
    {
      displayName: 'Component Tests',
      testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
      testMatch: ['<rootDir>/src/components/**/*.test.tsx']
    }
  ]
};
```

## Test Results
- **Total Tests:** 22 tests across 3 test suites
- **Pass Rate:** 100%
- **Coverage:** API routes and UI components
- **Environment:** Properly isolated test environments

## Benefits Achieved
1. **CI/CD Ready:** Test suite can now run in automated environments
2. **Reliable:** No more database connection conflicts
3. **Fast:** Mocked operations eliminate database dependencies
4. **Maintainable:** Clear separation of test environments
5. **Scalable:** Easy to add new tests with proper configuration

## Future Considerations
1. Consider adding integration tests with test database
2. Expand component test coverage
3. Add performance testing for API endpoints
4. Implement visual regression testing for UI components

## Commands for Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run API tests only
npm test -- --selectProjects="API Tests"

# Run component tests only
npm test -- --selectProjects="Component Tests"

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

This session successfully transformed a broken test suite into a robust, reliable testing infrastructure that supports the project's quality assurance and CI/CD requirements.
